# Work Day Scheduler 

The workday scheduler is a good way to quickly organize your daily schedule using the internet.

## About the project
This basic web-application makes it easy to write out and save a daily schedule for your workday. Tasks that have passed their deadline will turn red while tasks that lay in the future will be green. Tasks can be saved so that they will persist between uses of the application.
